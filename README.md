# MANTRA DAPP TEMPLATE

Minimal dapp template

It includes a simple smart contract and its frontend.

## Architecture

The smart contracts are found under the `contracts/` directory. The project is set up to be a multi-contract project,
so as the project grows in complexity you can add more contracts to this directory.

The frontend can be found under `webapp/`.

To learn more about each part of the project, please read the README in each directory.
